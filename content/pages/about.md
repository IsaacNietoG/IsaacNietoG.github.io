# Hi! Welcome to my halls of reflection!
![Yo](/images/me.jpg)

Hey! I’m Isaac (Tchai to my friends), a fifth-semester Computer Science student with a burning passion for technology, programming, and a deep dive into cybersecurity. My curiosity has led me to explore cryptography, network security, and ethical vulnerability exploitation, with an active focus on competing in Capture The Flag (CTF) events, like HackMex, where I’m sharpening my skills through daily machine challenges and crafting high-quality writeups. I’m aiming for a top spot and potentially build a career in cybersecurity. Beyond that, I’ve worked on projects like a “People Counter” using Python and OpenCV, and “Disbank,” a Java-based app integrating third-party APIs. I’m a fan of automation and system resilience, experimenting with tools like NixOS, WSL2, and rsync for backups, though some of these projects are paused to prioritize HackMex. This blog is my portfolio and a space to share insights on programming, cybersecurity, and my journey toward a productive, balanced life. If you’re into tech, cybersecurity, or just want to chat over a beer, hit me up!


## Personal Interests
### Favorite Music
I like a lot of types of music, but principally I vibe to a mix of Hip Hop, Boleros, and Indie Rock (eclectic, I know). Current favorites:

 - Supertramp
 - Roberto Carlos
 - OK Go
 - Cage The Elephant
 
### Favorite Series & Movies
 - Atlanta
 - Sons of Anarchy
 - Mr Robot
 - Lucifer
 - Altered Carbon
 
 I’m all about Sci-Fi, comedy, and gritty crime dramas.

### Books I'm reading

Currently, I am revisiting How to Make Friends and Influence Over People - Dale Carnegie, and reading King Warrior Magician Lover - Robert Moore. I was also reading Getting Things Done - Paul Allen.

- How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie (revisiting for charisma goals)
- King, Warrior, Magician, Lover by Robert Moore (exploring personal archetypes)
- Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer (slow but steady, diving into memory techniques)

I’m open to technical reads, philosophy, or books on building healthy habits.

### Hobbies & Activities

I love cycling to work (weather permitting, otherwise it’s the subway), jamming on my guitar, and hanging out with friends. I’m active in my university’s cybersecurity club, teaching and learning, and I’m eyeing future adventures in bushcraft and car mechanics. My blog might feature cycling trips or tech experiments, so stay tuned!
