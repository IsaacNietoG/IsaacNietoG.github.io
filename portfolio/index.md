    <h2><a href="./eddCanek">Data Structures in Java</a></h2>
    <p>
    Project for a Data Structures Course I took in second semester of my CS degree. In this project, I implemented in Java some of the most known data structures, like binary trees, stacks, queues and of course double linked lists. I also made some projects related to them including a (to be completed) graphicator among others. In this project I learned a lot about the data structures implemented and about the Java Programming Language.

    <p>
    A short project I made with my friend <a href="https://github.com/DystopianRescuer">@DystopianRescuer</a>. This is a real-time people counter that uses cutting edge AI models and computer vision techniques, to accurately count individuals crossing a predetermined virtual boundary.
