    <h2><a href="./eddCanek">Data Structures in Java</a></h2>
    <p>
    Project for a Data Structures Course I took in second semester of my CS degree. In this project, I implemented in Java some of the most known data structures, like binary trees, stacks, queues and of course double linked lists. I also made some projects related to them including a (to be completed) graphicator among others. In this project I learned a lot about the data structures implemented and about the Java Programming Language.
